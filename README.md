This repository contain some exploratory/proof-of-principle work
using deep learning to predict tissue type based on the H3K4me3 epigenetic mark.

The [data](data) was derived from my Master's project, and there are notes for using [GPUs to run Convoluted Neural Networks](src/python) and [calculating important features](src/rmd).
